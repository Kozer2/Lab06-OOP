This project was designed to have me create multiple classes and use inheritance to inherit and overrider with different concrete animals. 
It is a zoo of animals. 

Here is a drawing of my UML.

This was an Object Oriented Programming project. The OOP principles used were:
- Inheritance 
    - This is used by having a child class inherit traits or properties from its parent or grand-parent class
        - An exmaple of a time when I used this is when the SeaTurtle class inherits the eat trait of the Animal class.
- Abstractraction
    - This is used to hide internal implementation of details. 
        - This was used when I created my abstract classes for all my different elements of my UML.
- encapsulation
    -   is sued to hide details from the user
        - I did this by declaring my methods and classes public. Allowing others to see them.

### Instructions  
Create a minimum of 2 interfaces.
Each interface created should be implemented by more than one class.
Have at least one class implement more than one interface
Test your code with Unit testing
Label interfaces as <interface>
Do not implement your interfaces on your highest base class. The interfaces should be scattered among the application.

When running your application, it should output each of the concrete animals and one behavior that it has inherited without any direct code manipulation


### Unit Tests  
Test that your program has the following functionality:

Test that the classes that implement the interface actually implement it
Test inheritance
Test Polymorphism
Prove methods have been overridden
Prove that one of your concrete animals is an Animal
