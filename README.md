# Lab06-OOP

This project was designed to have me create multiple classes and use inheritance to inherit and overrider with different concrete animals. 
It is a zoo of animals. 

Here is a drawing of my UML.

This was an Object Oriented Programming project. The OOP principles used were:
- Inheritance 
    - This is used by having a child class inherit traits or properties from its parent or grand-parent class
        - An exmaple of a time when I used this is when the SeaTurtle class inherits the eat trait of the Animal class.
- Abstractraction
    - This is used to hide internal implementation of details. 
        - This was used when I created my abstract classes for all my different elements of my UML.
- encapsulation
    -   is sued to hide details from the user
        - I did this by declaring my methods and classes public. Allowing others to see them.
